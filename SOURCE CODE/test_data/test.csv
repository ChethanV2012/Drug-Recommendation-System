2,Saxenda,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on this medication almost a full month. I never feel hungry and have been eating WAY less than I ever have, however the scale has not moved. Bad heartburn has been my only side effect. I&#039;ll try it one more month and then if no weight loss, I&#039;m going to stop. Disappointed...and I had to pay $1,000 out of pocket!""",1,19-Feb-16,17,Negative
3,Sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim,Urinary Tract Infection,"""I took this antibiotic the second time I had a UTI. I had a quantity of 28 pills, but I was only meant to take 14 in a course of 7 days.  (why would they prescribe me 14 more pills !?)
So, after my 14th pill, my UTI symptoms never stopped. So I took the 15th pill. Immediately, I broke out in hives and rashes all over my body. so I stopped taking the antibiotic. The rash was so violent and itchy, I had to go to the emergency room where they gave me an IV with saline, benadryl, and steriods to help with my allergic reaction. 
many other people have allergic reactions  on this antibiotic. As if she wanted me to overdose
So please, I beg of you to do your research on this antibiotic. It could be life threatening!!""",1,11-Dec-17,0,Negative

8,Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""My time with skyla has been an absolute breeze. Ms. Skyla and i have been together since late october 2015 and it has been great. I must admit that the insertion is a bit painful,but you will soon forget. I got cramps for about a weekafter insertion. Nothing that a littlw ibuprofen couldnt tackle.

10,Ziana,Acne,"""I had a wonderful experience with Ziana. This is the only acne medication that didn&#039;t dry out my skin after using it. I thought I would never have a good experience with acne medications. Ziana is a smooth, moisturizing acne medication that leaves your skin feeling great. With a couple days the redness and swelling of my acne went down significantly. I don&#039;t see myself ever using another acne medication.""",10,30-May-15,11,Positive
