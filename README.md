## Drug Recommendation System based on Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews using Machine Learning üíä

![drug recommendation system Logo](screenshoot/Homepage.png)

The Drug Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application designed to recommend drugs based on sentiment analysis of user reviews. Given the increasing reliance on self-medication due to the unavailability of proper medical consultation, this system aims to provide accurate drug recommendations by analyzing patient reviews. The project leverages various machine learning techniques to predict sentiment and recommend the best-suited drugs for specific health conditions.
